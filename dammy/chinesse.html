            <h2>China Major Ethnic Groups</h2>
            <h3>The History Of Ethnicity In China</h3>
            <p>The Han community for years portrayed prosperity and grew both in numbers and geographical boundaries. Within two millenniums, the ethnic group had absorbed many minority groups in China to become the dominant ethnic group. This sinicization reduced the many different states of China facilitating unity in imperial China. The Han inability to endorse and respect the different cultures and religion of other ethnic groups promoted the need for independence among the minorities conceptualizing a cultural divide. However, the imperial rule of the Han in their locality lands flourished until the communists took power in 1949.<br>
                Different ethnic group had a right to operate freely and independently of the federal government and can also disaffiliate. After years of influence, China finally gave into communalism. This change in governance saw the end of the sinofication of the non-Han Chinese people. The government of China also accepted, the Muslims in the region as Chinese and endorsed Islam as a religion constituting of many separate ethnic groups.</p>
            
            <h3>The Han Chinese, 91.6%</h3>
            <p>This ethnic group is the largest community not only in China but also in the whole world.

            <h3>Hui Minority, 0.79%</h3>
            <p>This ethnic group practices the Islamic religion as they are descendants of the Turks but do not speak the dialect.

            <h3>Hot Pot</h3>
            <p>Hot pot, or hotpot (火锅 huǒguō), is one of the most popular dishes in China, especially in Sichuan Province or Chongqing. People cook in and eat from a simmering pot of soup stock (broth) on a gas/induction hob in the middle of the dining table with foodstuffs and condiments around the pot. People can add and cook whatever they like in the broth. The secret of whether a hot pot is good or not lies in the broth, which all the meat slices and vegetables take their flavor from.<br>

            <h3>Hanfu</h3>
            <p>Hanfu (Chinese: 汉服; pinyin: hànfú) is the traditional clothing of the Han Chinese people, with a history of over 4,000 years. The term "Hanfu" encompasses a range of historical clothing styles, characterized by their flowing lines, wide sleeves, and use of layers. The garment consists of a combination of a tunic or robe and a skirt or trousers, often with intricate designs and embroidery. The Hanfu's design is rooted in the Confucian principles of modesty and propriety. Although the popularity of Hanfu waned during the Ming and Qing dynasties, it has experienced a revival in recent years as people seek to reconnect with traditional Chinese culture.</p>
