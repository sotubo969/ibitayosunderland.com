                <h3 style="font-size: 25px;">The History Of Ethnicity In China</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">The Han community for years portrayed prosperity and grew both in numbers and 
                    geographical boundaries. Within two millenniums, the ethnic group had absorbed many minority groups in 
                    China to become the dominant ethnic group. This sinicization reduced the many different states of China 
                    facilitating unity in imperial China. The Han inability to endorse and respect the different cultures and 
                    religion of other ethnic groups promoted the need for independence among the minorities conceptualizing a 
                    cultural divide. However, the imperial rule of the Han in their locality lands flourished until the communists took power in 1949.<br>
                    Different ethnic group had a right to operate freely and independently of the federal government and can also disaffiliate. 
                    After years of influence, China finally gave into communalism. This change in governance saw the end of the sinofication of the non-Han 
                    Chinese people. The government of China also accepted, the Muslims in the region as Chinese and endorsed Islam as a religion 
                    constituting of many separate ethnic groups.</p>

            <h3 style="font-size: 25px;">4. Hot Pot</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                Hot pot, or hotpot (火锅 huǒguō), is one of the most popular dishes in China, especially in Sichuan Province or Chongqing. 
                People cook in and eat from a simmering pot of soup stock (broth) on a gas/induction hob in the middle of the dining table with foodstuffs 
                and condiments around the pot. People can add and cook whatever they like in the broth. The secret of whether a hot pot is good or not lies in 
                the broth, which all the meat slices and vegetables take their flavor from.<br>
                Chinese people are very fond of hot pot. In the past hot pot used to be favored only in winter, but nowadays hot pot has been appearing on tables all year round. 
                It is a great way to socialize with friends and relatives. People gather around the pot to eat while chatting, eating, drinking, and having fun.</p>

            <h3 style="font-size: 25px;">5. Dumplings</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                Dumplings (饺子 jiǎozi) are a traditional food type that is widely popular, especially in North China. Chinese dumplings consist of minced meat 
                and/or chopped vegetables wrapped in a thin dough skin. Popular fillings are minced pork, diced shrimp, ground chicken, beef, and vegetables. 
                Dumplings can be cooked by boiling, steaming, or frying.<br>
                Dumplings are also a traditional dish eaten on Chinese New Year’s Eve. As they look like Chinese silver ingots (Chinese money in old times), 
                it is believed that the more dumplings you eat during the New Year celebrations, the more money you will make in the New Year. Making dumplings is a 
                good way to interact with your friends and relatives.</p>

                <h3 style="font-size: 25px;">1. Hanfu — The Most Traditional Chinese Clothing</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                    The Hanfu ('Han clothing' — the majority of Chinese are of Han ethnicity) is the oldest of China's traditional clothes. Legend traces it back to over 
                    4,000 years ago when Huangdi's consort, Leizu, made cloth with silk. It was constantly improved throughout several dynasties.<br>
                    Until the Han Dynasty, the Hanfu was adopted and vigorously promoted by the ruling class. It then became the national clothing of the Han ethnic people. 
                    It also had a far-reaching influence on neighboring Asian countries, such as Korea, Japan, and Vietnam.<br>
                    Nowadays, people seldom wear Hanfu except on special occasions, such as festivals and wedding ceremonies, 
                    or by young girls who want to show off or taking photos.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                    The cheongsam (qipao) evolved from the Manchu women's changpao ('long gown') of the Qing Dynasty (1644–1912). 
                    The Manchu ethnic people were also called the Qi people by the Han people; hence their long gown was named qipao ('Qi gown').<br>
                    Originating in the Qing Dynasty, the cheongsam has mainly developed into Beijing styles, Shanghai styles and Hong Kong styles.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                    The Tang suit often refers to a type of Chinese jacket rather than the clothing of the Tang Dynasty (618–907). 
                    The origin of Tang suit actually only dates back to the Qing Dynasty era (1644–1911). It was developed from a type 
                    of the era's Manchurian clothing — the magua (马褂, 'horse gown').<br>
                    This name came from the overseas Chinese. As the Tang Empire was famous for being prosperous and powerful in the world, 
                    foreigners called the overseas Chinese people "the Tang people" and the clothes they wore were called "Tang suits" 
                    (which has been translated as Tangzhuang 唐装).<br>
                    The Tang suit is a duijin (对襟, a kind of Chinese-style jacket with buttons down the front) with a Mandarin collar 
                    (a band collar) and "frog" buttons (knobs formed of intricately knotted cord). </p>

                <h3 style="font-size: 25px;">4. The Zhongshan Suit — Traditional Formal Attire for Men</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                    The Zhongshan suit, also known as the Mao suit overseas, is a type of men's jacket. 
                    It was first advocated by Dr Sun Yat-sen (Sun Zhongshan in Mandarin, hence Zhongshan suit).<br>
                    The design of Zhongshan suits combines traditional Chinese and Western clothing styles. 
                    Zhongshan suits have four big pockets on the front, two up two down, equally spaced left and right. 
                    There are five central buttons on the front and three smaller buttons on each sleeve. 
                    Zhongshan suits can be worn on formal and casual occasions because of their symmetrical shape, generous appearance, elegance, 
                    and stable impression.</p>
