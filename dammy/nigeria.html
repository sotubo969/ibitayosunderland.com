            <h3 style="font-size: 25px;">Brief History</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                Nigeria as a nation has a rich and complex history which can be traced to when it first became a British protectorate in 1901. 
                As a colony, it was initially divided into the Southern Nigeria Protectorate and Northern Nigeria Protectorate. 
                The southwest has always been dominated by the Yoruba people, descendants of the Oyo Empire, while the southeast has 
                always been dominated by the Igbo people from the Nri Kingdom. 
                Most of the north is inhabited by the Hausa and Fulani people who are descendants of the Hausa Kingdom, Fulani Empire and Songhai Empire.
                These tribes, Yoruba, Hausa and Igbo, are the three major tribes in Nigeria. 
                However, there exists a large number of other tribes with over 520 languages, 
                some of which had initially branched out from these main three. 
                This is an ultimate guide to some of the indigenous people of Nigeria.</p>
            <h3 style="font-size: 25px;">Hausa</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                The Hausa people are the largest tribe in Nigeria, making up approximately 25% of the population. Hausaland is concentrated in northern Nigeria, situated between the River Niger and Lake Chad.<br>
                The Hausa practise a very homogenised culture, keeping their traditions and way of life during and after colonisation. Islam is the main religion of Hausas and is said to have been brought by traders from Mali and Guinea during their trade exchanges, which they quickly adapted. Aside from English, they primarily speak the Hausa language.

            <h3 style="font-size: 25px;">Yoruba</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                The Yoruba people make up the second largest tribe, constituting an estimated 21% of the population. 
                The Yoruba states are located in southwest and north central regions of Nigeria.
                 However, Yoruba speakers can also be found in parts of nearby countries, such as Benin Republic and Togo.<br>
                
                The Yoruba people practise Christianity and Islam, while a minority still follow ancestral traditional beliefs. 
                They are people of many cultural traditions, and Ile Ife which in Yoruba mythology is where life began is 
                held as the spiritual centre of the Yoruba tribe.</p>

            <h3 style="font-size: 25px;">Igbo</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                Igbo
                The Igbo people are descendants of the Nri Kingdom, the oldest in Nigeria. 
                They have many customs and traditions and can be found in southeast Nigeria, consisting of about 18% of the population. 
                This tribe differs from the others in that there is no hierarchical system of governance. 
                Instead, a traditional republican system exists with a consultative assembly of people, which guarantees equality to citizens.<br>
                The Igbo people also had their traditional beliefs, but after colonisation, 
                the majority (more than 90%) converted to practise Christianity, with a large number becoming Catholic.<br>
                The Igbo people also play an important part in the Nigerian oil trade since most of this natural resource is found within Igbo land.</p>
